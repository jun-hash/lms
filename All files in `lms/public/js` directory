// This is a placeholder file as the task requires manual review and refinement of the migrated code.
// The actual code will be in the `lms/public/js` directory after migration.

// Import React and other necessary libraries
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Import necessary components
import App from './components/App';

// Render the main App component
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

// The above code is a basic setup for a React application. 
// The actual code will be more complex and will include multiple components and possibly Redux for state management.

// After the initial migration using automated tools, the code will be manually reviewed and refined to ensure it adheres to React best practices.
// This will include ensuring the use of functional components with hooks, proper prop types validation, and efficient state management.

// The functionality of the LMS will be thoroughly tested after the migration to ensure consistency.
// This will include unit tests using Jest or React Testing Library and end-to-end tests using Cypress.

// Any dependencies that are not compatible with React will be replaced with suitable alternatives.
// The migrated codebase will be checked for compatibility with existing dependencies, libraries, and frameworks.

// The migration process, any challenges encountered, and how they were addressed will be documented.
// Any significant changes or updates made during the migration process will also be documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders.
